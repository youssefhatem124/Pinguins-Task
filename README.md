# Pinguins-Task
For running the application 
First you need to build the application through mvn package 
# How to access the application (the URL)
Postman collection provided in mail
you run it through main method and access apis using postman collection provided in the mail 
# Technicial Choices I made
Depend on Inheritance in case of Bugs and Stories in order to describe the relation between entites and keep issues in the same table which make it easier in quering data from and dealing with 
#Algorithm for planning
Depended on two cases mainly 
a case at which developer count is less than stories and in this case the developer is going to take stories as long as sum of estimated points less than 10,The other case is handled normaly as developers count is more than stories which makes it easy to divide stories 

# Problem faced
Describing the relations between bugs ,Issues and stories
the algorithm for planning of tasks .
# Parts I chose to leave out 
The algorithm could be enhanced more in terms of efficency  but the current one has no flows

# How you would continue to resolve them if you had more time?
Try to add some machine learning feature to algorithm.
